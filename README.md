# Advent of Code 2024 in Javascript

My [Advent of Code 2024 solutions](http://adventofcode.com/2024) in the Javascript programming language.

## Running solutions

Each solution file expects as parameter the path to a text file containing the input for the specific day.

```bash
# Example: running solution for day 01, part 1
node src/day01-1.js /path/to/input.txt
```
